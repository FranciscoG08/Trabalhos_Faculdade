We live in an era where society is increasingly dependent on technology, using it, for example, to automate, control, and manage residential environments. Residential automation, one of the fastest-growing sectors worldwide, is gaining traction by offering innovative solutions that promote comfort, security, and efficiency in homes.

This project aims to develop a residential automation system to integrate and centralize various smart devices and systems, with the goal of enhancing comfort, security, and efficiency in the home.

For this purpose, the \gls{HA} platform was used, chosen for its flexibility and ability to integrate a wide range of smart devices, enabling centralized control of different systems. Additionally, \gls{YAML} was utilized for system configuration and personalization, providing a simple and readable way to define integrations and automations. The combination of these tools enabled the development of an effective solution for intelligent control of residential environments.
